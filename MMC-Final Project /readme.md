This is an application for music lovers. Users could input their current mood for getting a random music playlist from Spotify. The system also connected to a physical cloud, and it would change the color while the user input different mood.  

I would like to combine the knowledge that I got from the Dynamic data class and the p com class to build a “Music Cloud” with Spotify API. For the database, I would like to create a form to input the mood to get the playlist and play the tracks in the playlist from Spotify. And for the Arduino, I would like to build a “Color cloud”, and input the data and to change the RGB LED color based on the mood of the music. (Component: RGB LED)

The first challenge I’ve encountered is that I would like to add a Spotify widget to let the user play the track on the same webpage. And it takes me some time to figure out about how to add a dynamic widget since the playlist should correspond with the mood. And I finally overcame that problem. 
The second challenge is how to make the led color respond with the mood. Zeven suggested me that I could use Johnny five which is the JavaScript Robotics & IoT Platform. But what I could do with it is to get the led color changes randomly. Zeven would like to help me out with using the p5.serialport, but we didn’t make it. 

From the process of doing my final project, I’ve learned a lot about how to combine different tech to one project. And it was a very good practice of what I learned during this semester.
